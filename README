csv2plist.py

Creates a plist array from a list of records in a CSV (using the first column only). Will soon allow for creating of dictionaries - but that's not implemented yet.

Usage
Usage is simple, just invoke from the command line:

python csv2plist.py csvfile [output plist file] [type]

output plist file is optional, if unused it'll create a plist in the same directory as the CSV
type is going to be used for 'array' or 'dict'. At the moment it always defaults to 'array' so you can completely ignore this parameter.

Examples
python csv2plist.py mycsv.csv
outputs: mycsv.plist in the same directory as mycsv.csv

python csv2plist.py mycsv.csv myplist.plist
outputs: myplist.plist in the same directory as mycsv.csv
